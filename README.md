# Relations Checker

This project provides a utility to check various properties of a relation, such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, antisymmetry, and comparability. It also offers functions to determine if a relation is partially or totally ordered.

## Features

- Check if a relation is **reflexive**, **symmetric**, **transitive**, **antisymmetric**, or **comparable**.
- Determine if a relation is **partially ordered** or **totally ordered**.
- Accepts user input for the set and the relation.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. You'll be prompted to input a comma-separated list of numbers for set \(X\).
3. You'll then be prompted to input a comma-separated list of tuples to define the relation \(R\).
4. The program will display results for each property checked against the relation.
